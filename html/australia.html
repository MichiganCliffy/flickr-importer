This is in addition to tasting some fantastic wines and eating some fantastic food.</p>

<p><strong><em>Oct 22<sup>nd</sup></em></strong>: From Taltarni, a painful (hungover) drive to the coast via the
<a href="http://www.parkweb.vic.gov.au/1park_display.cfm?park=109" title="Grampians National Park" target="_Blank">Grampians National Park</a>. Along the way I
saw a pair of Red Kangaroo's. I tried to stop and get pictures, but they were moving way too fast (they kept up with my car as I drove along the road). In the
Grampians, I hiked up to Boronia Peak, which offered some great views across the flatlands to the east and the hills to the west. After a nap, and a few missed
turns, I reached Port Campbell on the coast.</p>

<p><strong><em>Oct 25<sup>th</sup> - Nov 1<sup>st</sup></em></strong>: Trekking around Tasmania with

the beautiful <a href="/travellog/australia/photograph/296187787/57d56409ec" title="Wineglass Bay">Wineglass Bay</a> and spent the night at a campsite with
some friends of Anne and Jeff. As we were packing up the next morning, we had a visit from a

<p>Cradle Mountain was definitely one of the highlights of the trip. The first evening there, we went on a couple of quick, short hikes to check things out
(and hopefully see a Tasmanian Devil). We didn't see any Tasmanian Devil's, but we did see a whole bunch of Wallaby's and a few
<a href="/travellog/australia/photograph/296195562/79c8492021" title="Fearsome Wombat">Wombats</a>. After a few drinks at the lodge (and a few more back at
the ol' cozy cabin) we turned in. The next day we hiked around

in Tasmania, we actually saw the sun! The hike provided a great view of the peak, plus some real interesting snow covered, wooded sections - a few hours
well spent.</p>

<p>At this point, Anne had to leave us to go back to work (boo). The rest of us went on a quick hike up to

then slowly made our way back to Hobart.</p>

<p><strong><em>Nov 1<sup>st</sup> - Nov 6<sup>th</sup></em></strong>: Sadly had to say goodbye to Anne and Jeff, and headed to Canberra to meet up with my
Aunt Mary. We spent the night at my Cousin Mark's place, giving me the opportunity to be a jungle gym for his three young kids. Mark was not there,
unfortunately, but I met his wife Joann and their rambunctious kids. From there we drove down to Cobargo, south along the coast, to
