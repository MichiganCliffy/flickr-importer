<p><strong><em>April 19<sup>th</sup></em></strong>: I'm in my car, leaving from 
	Tahoe, destination - somewhere in Utah (I haven't made up my mind yet). It's a 
	long drive, with a minor stop in Nevada due to a speeding ticket (damn). It 
	takes about 12 hours to get to Salt Lake City, from there I head south and 
	finally call it quits at a Holiday Inn somewhere off I15. I was pleasantly 
	surprised at the scenery in Eastern Nevada - I had no idea there were mountains 
	in Nevada, I always assumed it was mostly desert. Western Utah is pretty dull - 
	all desert and salt flats.</p>

<p><strong><em>April 20<sup>th</sup></em></strong>: I make it to Bryce Canyon. It 
	is still winter, and at an elevation of 10k ft, there is still snow on the 
	ground. The contrast between the red rocks and mud, the white of the snow, and 
	the blue, blue sky is absolutely fantastic. I get a campsite at the park, and 
	set out for a hike.</p>
<p>This park is amazing. The colors, rock formations, and big sky landscapes are 
	breath taking. I highly recommend a trip to Bryce, it is truly a unique place. 
	I only spent one night there (one cold night). I decide to backtrack a bit and 
	head west to Zion.</p>
<p><strong><em>April 21<sup>st</sup></em></strong>: I arrive at Zion National Park. 
	The drive into the park is awesome - complete with a tunnel drive though the 
	rock canyon. The park reminds me of Yosemite Valley, but instead of gray rock, 
	there is red rock.</p>

<p>I get a campsite for a night, and decide to warm up my mountain bike. I pedal 
	around the park, stopping and locking up the bike at various points to hike 
	around and take pictures. I managed to loose myself a bit, taking pictures and 
	wandering, emerging from some back road trail I came across a fellow lost 
	traveller. Turns out she is a writer/photographer for a small Los Angeles 
	magazine - she takes my picture (she thinks I look like some sort of back 
	country explorer). I head back to the car and cook up some serious grub.</p>
<p>It starts to rain a bit, and I start planning my route to Moab. I decide to 
	drive back past Bryce and through Grand Escalante National Forrest.</p>
<p><strong><em>April 22<sup>nd</sup></em></strong>: I start my drive. What a wild 
	ride?!? I pass through a snow storm, pass by monstrous mesa's, through a wind 
	storm, cut through Capitol Reef National Park, hit a sand storm, and finally 
	arrive in Moab. I decide to treat myself to a night in a real bed and get a 
	hotel room in town. I so needed that shower.</p>
<p>Moab is a little town in the south east corner of Utah. There is no real 
	industry there, other than adventure tourism and some random drilling and 
	grazing sites. The city is surrounded by Arches and Canyonlands National Parts, 
	and the Colorado River runs nearby.</p>
<p>The area surrounding Moab is known for spectacular mountain biking, 
	hiking/canyoning, rafting, and rock climbing. I would also add photography, the 
	landscape is gorgeous, with dramatic big-sky vistas that are simply stunning. 
	This is a part of the US that I will have to visit again.</p>

<p><strong><em>April 23<sup>rd</sup> - April 26<sup>th</sup></em></strong>: My days 
	are made up of hiking, biking, and taking pictures. I generally alternated 
	between hiking and biking, mostly to change up muscle usage. I biked the <a href="http://www.utahmountainbiking.com/trails/slickrck.htm" target="_Blank" title="Slickrock Trail">
		Slickrock trail</a>, as well as a couple of warm up rides at <a href="http://www.utahmountainbiking.com/trails/bartlett.htm" target="_Blank" title="Bartlett Wash">
		Bartlett Wash</a> and <a href="http://www.utahmountainbiking.com/trails/klondike.htm" target="_Blank" title="Klondike Bluffs">
		Klondike Bluffs</a>, and a killer ride called the <a href="http://www.utahmountainbiking.com/trails/flatpass.htm" target="_Blank" title="Flat Pass Trail">
		Flat Pass Trail</a>.</p>
<p>Slickrock (basically sandstone) is a lot of fun to ride on. Bike tires tend to 
	stick to the rock, allowing the rider to climb and descend some very steep 
	inclines. The Klondike Bluffs trail had some petrified dinosaurs footprints 
	along the trail, not your usual scenery. The Flat Pass Trail was a beast, 19 
	miles round trip, 4 stream crossings, multiple shelf climbs, and some wicked 
	descents. So much fun.</p>
<p>On my off days, I hiked around Arches National Park, as well as a drive and hike 
	at <a href="http://www.moab-utah.com/photo/deadhorsepoint/" target="_Blank" title="Dead Horse Point">
		Dead Horse Point</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>April 27<sup>th</sup></em></strong>: The long drive home (and I mean <em>
		long</em>). I decide to drive back using Highway 50, "America's Loneliest 
	Highway." It lived up to it's name, and was a very interesting drive. There 
	really is not much in Nevada, nothing at all. I got to Reno, and decided to 
	push on through home to San Francisco. By the time I got home, my right butt 
	cheek was cramping up (I really missed Cruise Control on that drive).</p>
<p>Next up, heading to Europe for a month.... I love unemployment....</p>
