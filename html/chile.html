<p><strong><em>April 2<sup>nd</sup></em></strong>: Sitting on the plane, waiting to leave Los Angeles at 8:00 PM,
I realize that the arrival time I have given my sister is 12 hours off (doh!). The flight is long, with a hour
and a half layover in Lima, Peru. I finally arrive, around noon on Sunday, and lo and behold, there is a driver
waiting for me. I reach Nicki's dorm an hour later.</p>

<p>Nicki, and half her dorm, is nursing a bit of a hangover. We walk down the street to a restuarant and order a
big old plate of meat. I mean a BIG plate of meat. I down a healthy portion, then the jet lag hits. Not much else
happens that day.</p>
	
<p><strong><em>April 4<sup>th</sup></em></strong>: Jump on a bus for Valpariaso. Nice bus, seriously nice bus. We pass
over the coastal mountains and through the vineyards west of Santiago. It's pretty dry, much like the South
West - New Mexico and Arizona. We arrive in Valpo and promptly get on a bus and get lost. Nicki takes the rains
(a common theme on this trip) and gets us pointed in the right direction again. We wander the streets and check
out the rickety old ascensores that take people up the hills. A very interesting, and active, old port town.
It's a little beat up, and their are wild dogs everywhere, but it is lively.</p>

<p>Sis heads back to Santiago, and I crash at a little Hostel (Casa Familiar Carrasco) up on a hill with
fantastic views of the port and city. I meet a couple from Luxenburg at breakfast and we end up meeting up in
Viña del Mar and have a nasty Chinese lunch. I check out the Easter Island museum and spend some time on the
beach chillin'.</p>

<p><strong><em>April 6<sup>th</sup></em></strong>: Nicki and I are on a plane bound for the bottom of world,
more presisely Puntas Arenas. Then we're on a bus headin for Puerto Natales, where we'll spend the night before
heading to
<a href="http://www.torresdelpaine.com/ingles/index.asp" target="_Blank" title="Torres del Paine">Torres
del Paine</a>.</p>

<p>Torres del Paine is absolutely breath taking. It is one of the most amazing places I have ever been to, and
two and a half days is not nearly enough time to see it properly. Once in the park, we take the ferry to the
<a href="http://www.torresdelpaine.com/ingles/secciones/noticias/5.asp" target="_Blank" title="Refugio Pehoé">Refugio
Pehoé</a>, and then sprint to see
<a href="http://www.interpatagonia.com/paseos/entre_cristales/index_i.html" target="_Blank" title="Grey Glacier">Grey
Glacier</a>, which is massive (at least 5 or 6 stories high). We spend the night at the refugio with a nice
dinner and bottle of wine.</p>

<p>Now began our 14 mile march to the Torres Refugio, with winds howling at what feels like 80 mph winds that
blows from all directions - up, down, north, south, in front of you and from behind. It was a very long hike,
but there were some fantastic views of the peaks. The wind was so strong that it would actually stop waterfalls,
and pretty much tossed Nicki and I around like rag dolls.</p>

<p>We make the refugio, exhausted and sore, but alive. The refugio is pretty basic, especially considering the
luxury of the Pehoé Refugio, but there are a bunch of people (aussies mostly) hanging out and drinking beer -
we join right in. Then the longest night begins, with the loudest snorer I have ever encountered. This guy was
rediculus, people two rooms over could hear him. Argggg, I did not sleep a wink.</p>

<p>Next, we try to hike up to the Torres, but my feet are killing me and Nicki is having problems with her knee,
so we turn around. Just as well, the clouds roll in and you can't see them anyway. Have to save it for another
trip.</p>

<p>The last adventure in Patagonia is attempting to get to the airport before our flight leaves. There are only
two buses that go to Puntas Arenas - one at 9:00 AM and one at 1:00 PM. Our flight is at 4:20 PM. We try and
catch the 9:00 AM, but it's fully booked. We get tickets for the 1:00 PM and sit around waiting - nothing is
open cause it's Sunday so we end up aimlessly wandering the 4 blocks that is Puerto Natalas. The bus gets to
the airport right at 4:00 and we scramble to get checked in. No problem, we're all set.</p>

<p><strong><em>April 11<sup>th</sup></em></strong>: Nicki is back in Santiago for school, I'm in a little town
up in the lake district called Pucón. It is a cloudy, gray day when I arrive, and I spend most of my day
attempting to get my laundry done (at this point, I reak). As the sun starts to set, the clouds disappear,
and there, dominating the skyline is the Villarrica volcano.</p>

<p>Pucón is a cool, little mountain town, very much like Tahoe. It's a fun mix of yuppies, environmentalists,
and mountain folk. Throw in the odd Mapuche indian and you have Pucón. I spent 3 days there, mostly hiking around
the volcano.</p>

<p>I had rented a car, so I could drive around and explore. Needless to say, I had some (mis)adventures driving
around the dirt roads that are around Pucón. I almost got the damn thing stuck on the east side of the Villarrica
park, I swear the map made the road look like a regular highway - not a beat up, 4 wheel drive, mountain road. I
also went rafting on one of the most beautiful rivers I have ever seen, and spent some time soaking in a thermal
pool just outside of town.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to climb the volcano. I had booked a spot with a guide, got all suited up and
was on my way to the mountain when we heard that the authorities had just raised the alert level on the mountain
and were not little people go up to the rim of the volcano. Our guide was tempted to go up anyway, but the local
television media where present, and the guide did not want to risk getting caught. Oh well, next time. (For those

I found on the volcano).</p>

<p><strong><em>April 8<sup>th</sup></em></strong>: Back in Santiago. Take sis out for a nice dinner and get ready
to return to reality (sigh). The smog in Santiago is oppressive, it gets in your nose, eyes, and throat. The
ironic thing is, all the locals smoke like chimneys, jeez, you'd think they would have had enough of smoke.</p>

<p><strong><em>April 10<sup>th</sup></em></strong>: Back in San Francisco. This was an AMAZING trip, and I will
go back. I think I am going to start planning a trip to patagonia cause there is so much more to explore. I
highly recommend visiting there.</p>
